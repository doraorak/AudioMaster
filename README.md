# Requirements
I couldn't get it to work with tweakloaders, but it works if you manually inject the dylib load command via tools like trollfools or sideloadly. The tweak works in jailed as well.

# Usage
To use, press and hold with two fingers in the app. A menu will appear where you can change the configuration. There is a persistence mode in the settings, if you eneable that you don't have to setup your config everytime you launch the app.
